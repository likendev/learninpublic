# Linux Commands

```zsh
timedatectl set-local-rtc 0
```

The command `timedatectl set-local-rtc 0` is used to configure the Real-Time Clock (RTC) to use UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) rather than local time. In the context of Linux systems, this command is part of the `systemd` suite, which is a system and service manager used by many Linux distributions.
